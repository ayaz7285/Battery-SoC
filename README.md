# Battery-SOC-Estimation
This is the battery soc estimation code for lab EE401

A simple and naive battery modelisation + Kalman filter for state of charge (SoC) estimation

## Python implementation
python3 implementation of an extended Kalman filter for state of charge (SoC) estimation of a simulated lithium battery. 

To run it for extended kalman filters results just launch:
```sh
$> python Python/main.py
```

To run it for kalman filters results just launch:
```sh
$> python Python/main.py
```
Or use any python IDE (spyder/ jupyter notebook) and run the above mentioned files.

## Dependencies:
    - python3
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
